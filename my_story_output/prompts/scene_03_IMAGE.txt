SCENE 3: Indra's Thunderbolt
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A cinematic and dramatic wide shot of Hanuman plummeting from the celestial heavens after being struck by Indra's Vajra. Time of day: Late afternoon, just before sunset. Lighting: Golden hour, warm color temperature (2700K). A strong, directional light source from the west illuminates Hanuman's descent, creating long, dramatic shadows stretching downwards. The sky is a vibrant mix of orange, pink, and deep indigo, with scattered cirrus clouds catching the last rays of the sun. Camera Angle: Low angle, looking up at Hanuman from the perspective of the earth below. Framing: Rule of thirds, with Hanuman positioned slightly off-center on the right-hand side of the frame, emphasizing the vastness of the sky and the depth of his fall. Environment: A swirling vortex of golden dust trails behind Hanuman, created by the Vajra's impact. Distant, snow-capped Himalayan peaks are visible on the horizon, partially obscured by a light haze. The air shimmers with ethereal particles. Color Palette: Dominant colors are warm golds, oranges, and pinks contrasted with deep blues and purples. Saturation is high, creating a vibrant and otherworldly feel. Contrast is also high, emphasizing the dramatic lighting. Hanuman: Depicted as a powerful simian figure, now limp and unconscious. His fur is a rich, golden brown, slightly singed and smoking where the Vajra struck. His expression is blank, his limbs are relaxed and dangling. He wears simple golden ornaments (armlets, bracelets). His posture suggests a loss of control. Background: Celestial clouds are thick and layered, catching light differently to add depth. Small, stylized representations of deities (Gandharvas, Apsaras) are partially obscured in the clouds, subtly witnessing the event. Props: The Vajra, though not visible striking Hanuman, has left a visible arc of searing energy that quickly dissipates, leaving the golden dust. Artistic Style: Cinematic realism with a touch of stylized fantasy. Depth of Field: Shallow depth of field, with Hanuman sharply in focus and the background slightly blurred, drawing attention to his fall. Bokeh: Soft, warm bokeh in the background from the sun filtering through the clouds. Weather: Clear skies with a slight haze. Atmosphere: Ethereal and charged with divine energy. Air Quality: Dusty, shimmering, and filled with particles.
