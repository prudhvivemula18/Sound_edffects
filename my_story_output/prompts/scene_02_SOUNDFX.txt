SCENE 2: Infant's Leap
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The scene opens with a gentle, warm ambient soundscape consisting of distant birds chirping, rustling leaves in a light breeze, and the faint sound of a nearby river. At 0s, a whooshing sound effect begins, building in intensity to accompany Hanuman's leap. This should sound like wind rushing past him, subtly magical and divine in nature, not aggressively windy. From 2s to 4s, during the slow-motion sequence, a subtle, ethereal musical cue is introduced – perhaps a single, high-pitched flute or harp melody. This music should be delicate and underscore the beauty of the moment. As the camera zooms in from 7s to 8s, the whooshing sound intensifies slightly, and a brief, sparkling chime sound effect is added as he nears the sun. The overall sound design prioritizes warmth and magic. Spatial audio is used to position the bird sounds in the distance and to create a sense of depth. The music fades out before the scene ends, leaving only the intensified whooshing sound as the screen fades. Volume levels are carefully balanced to ensure that the narration is clear and the sound effects are supportive rather than overwhelming. The ambient sounds should be subtle and atmospheric, creating a sense of place. Add light foley sound of clothing rustling during his leap, but keep the foley subtle. No hard impacts, etc., are used. Emphasis is given to a crescendo of awe in sound as Hanuman approaches his goal. Music style: Lightly orchestral, mystical, hopeful. Instruments: Flute, harp, strings. Tempo: Slow during the slow motion, otherwise mid-tempo.
