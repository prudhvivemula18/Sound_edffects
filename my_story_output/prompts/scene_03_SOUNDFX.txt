SCENE 3: Indra's Thunderbolt
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient Sounds: Subtle wind sounds (gentle gusts), distant rumbling thunder, faint celestial hum (high-pitched and ethereal). Action-Specific Sound Effects: Powerful crackling and explosive sound of the Vajra striking (layered with electrical zaps and thunderous boom), followed by a whooshing sound as Hanuman falls, and a lighter, tinkling sound as golden dust disperses. Foley Details: Rustling of Hanuman's fur as he falls, faint metallic clinking of his ornaments. Music Style: Orchestral, with strings and brass, creating a sense of tragedy and grandeur. Instruments: Strings (cello, viola), brass (French horn, trumpet), and percussion (timpani, cymbals). Tempo: Slow and deliberate. Mood: Somber, dramatic, and slightly melancholic. Audio Transitions: Smooth fades between sound effects and music. Spatial Audio Considerations: Vajra strike should have a wide stereo image to emphasize its power. Hanuman's falling sound should move downwards in the stereo field. Emotional Impact Through Sound: Emphasize the sheer force of the Vajra and the devastating effect on Hanuman. Volume Levels: Vajra strike – High volume, Hanuman's fall – Medium volume, Ambient sounds – Low volume, Music – Subtle, but supporting the overall mood. Mixing Notes: Ensure that all sound elements are balanced and blend seamlessly to create a cohesive and immersive soundscape. A slight reverb effect on the Vajra strike and the celestial hum to enhance the sense of space and scale.
