================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The scene opens with a slow, smooth crane up from the base of the mountain towards Anjana at 0s. At 2s, the camera begins a slow, subtle dolly in towards Anjana, emphasizing her expression. From 2s to 4s, the celestial light intensifies and Vayu's presence becomes more defined, with subtle shimmering effects animating the wind. Anjana's sari flows gently in the simulated breeze. At 4s, the camera holds steady, focusing on Anjana's face as she receives the blessing. From 4s to 6s, a soft, golden light pulsates gently around Anjana, emanating from the celestial beam. At 6s, the camera begins a slow, subtle push in further, focusing on her hopeful eyes. A subtle parallax effect is applied to the distant mountains in the background to enhance depth. From 6s to 8s, the camera slowly zooms in on Anjana's face as she closes her eyes in acceptance of the blessing. The wind animation becomes slightly more pronounced in the final two seconds. No hard cuts or transitions; all camera movements are slow, smooth, and deliberate, creating a sense of serenity and anticipation. The overall pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the viewer to absorb the emotional weight of the moment. Cinematic technique used is a slow ramp up of the celestial light intensity, culminating in a subtle glow at 8s. The movement flow is fluid and continuous, drawing the viewer's eye towards Anjana.
