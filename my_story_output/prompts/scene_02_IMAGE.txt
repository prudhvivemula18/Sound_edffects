SCENE 2: Infant's Leap
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A breathtaking close-up captures infant Hanuman, no older than six months, mid-leap towards the rising sun. He is plump, rosy-cheeked, and utterly delighted, his eyes wide with innocent wonder. He wears a simple golden loincloth. His tiny hands are outstretched, reaching towards the enormous, radiant orb. The sun dominates the frame, a colossal sphere of molten orange and fiery gold, its surface churning with implied heat and solar flares (stylized, not photorealistic). The lighting is dramatic and high-key. It’s pre-sunrise; the sky behind the sun graduates from a deep indigo at the top to a vibrant, rosy pink near the horizon (#FF69B4). A thin band of emerald green marks the distant horizon, suggesting lush forests. Golden light from the sun casts long, warm shadows downwards from Hanuman. The air shimmers with heat haze. Focus is razor-sharp on Hanuman's face and outstretched hands, with the sun slightly out of focus, creating a beautiful bokeh effect highlighting its immensity. Camera angle is low, looking up at a dramatic diagonal. The rule of thirds places Hanuman in the lower left quadrant, drawing the eye upwards and to the right towards the sun. The overall mood is one of joyous innocence and boundless aspiration. Artistic style: cinematic realism with a touch of stylized fantasy. Texture detail is crucial: the softness of Hanuman's skin, the rough weave of his loincloth, the almost palpable heat emanating from the sun. The depth of field is shallow, emphasizing the connection between the infant and the sun. Air quality is clear, with the exception of heat haze rippling from the sun's surface. The entire scene glows with warmth and light.
