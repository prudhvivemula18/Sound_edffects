================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

Camera starts on a wide shot, slowly tilting upwards, tracking Hanuman's fall. Camera movement: Smooth, slow upward tilt following Hanuman's descent, maintaining a consistent distance. Speed: Slow and deliberate, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. Acceleration: Linear, no abrupt changes. Character movement: Hanuman plummets downwards, limbs limp, body rotating slowly. Golden dust swirls around him, gradually dissipating. Environmental Animations: Dust particles swirl and fade, clouds gently shift and change shape. Light flickers and dims slightly as Hanuman falls. Transition effects: None. Pacing and rhythm: Slow and deliberate, building tension. Key moments: 0s: Start of Hanuman's fall, 2s: Hanuman begins to rotate noticeably, 4s: Himalayan peaks become more visible in the background, 6s: Golden dust trail begins to fade significantly, 8s: Hanuman is significantly lower in the frame. Cinematic Techniques: Slow motion (75%) on Hanuman's fall to highlight the drama. Parallax effect as the distant mountains scroll by more slowly than the closer clouds. Movement flow: Continuous, smooth, and realistic depiction of a body falling through the air. The dust trail dissipates realistically, based on aerodynamic principles. Speed ramps will be considered at 2-3 seconds if needed to emphasize the acceleration of the fall.
