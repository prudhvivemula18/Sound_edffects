================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A wide, establishing shot reveals Anjana, a breathtakingly beautiful apsara, kneeling in prayer at the peak of a mystical, windswept mountain. The scene is bathed in the soft, ethereal glow of early dawn. The sky is a gradient of pale lavender (#E6E6FA) and soft orange (#FFB347), creating a serene and hopeful mood. The mountain peak is sparsely covered with ancient, gnarled trees with silvery bark and delicate, wind-blown leaves. Anjana is positioned slightly off-center to the left, adhering to the rule of thirds. She wears a flowing, saffron-colored sari adorned with intricate gold embroidery that catches the light. Her dark hair cascades down her back, intertwined with jasmine flowers. Her hands are clasped in prayer, her face upturned towards the sky, exhibiting an expression of intense devotion and hopefulness. A beam of celestial light, warm white with a hint of gold (#FFD700), descends from the heavens, enveloping her in a radiant glow. The light refracts through swirling mists, creating a subtle bokeh effect in the background. Vayu, the wind god, appears as a subtle, swirling vortex of air and shimmering light behind her, barely visible but suggesting immense power. The focus is sharp on Anjana's face and hands, with a shallow depth of field blurring the background slightly. The air is crisp and clean, with a slight haze adding to the mystical atmosphere. Camera angle is slightly low, looking up at Anjana to emphasize her importance and the divine nature of the scene. The style is cinematic realism with a touch of fantasy. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with a high dynamic range to capture the interplay of light and shadow. Highlights are on Anjana's face and the celestial light, creating a sense of divine presence. Shadows are soft and subtle, adding depth and dimension.
