SCENE 1: Anjana's Blessing
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds: Gentle wind chimes tinkling softly, distant birdsong, rustling leaves, faint sounds of flowing water. Action-specific sound effects: A whooshing sound accompanying the descent of the celestial light (at 2s), a subtle crackling sound as the light intensifies (at 4s), a soft, ethereal hum throughout the scene. Foley details: Sound of Anjana's sari rustling gently, soft sounds of her bare feet on the stone ground. Music style: Ethereal and calming, featuring strings (harp, cello) and flute. Tempo: Slow and meditative. Mood: Serene, hopeful, and mystical. Audio transitions: Smooth fades between ambient sounds and music. Spatial audio: Use stereo positioning to create a sense of spaciousness and depth. The wind chimes and birdsong should come from different directions. Emotional impact: Use the soundscape to reinforce the sense of divine presence and Anjana's deep devotion. Volume levels: Keep the ambient sounds subtle, allowing the music and key sound effects (celestial light) to take center stage. Mixing notes: Create a balanced mix that allows all elements to be heard clearly without any one element overpowering the others.
