SCENE 2: Infant's Leap
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The scene begins with a static shot of baby Hanuman already mid-leap. At 0 seconds, his tiny body is rising swiftly towards the sun. Between 0s and 2s, the camera smoothly dollies backward and slightly upward, emphasizing the vastness of the sky and the sun's immense size relative to Hanuman. This shot should be done with careful attention paid to parallax; the background elements should move relative to the foreground. From 2s to 4s, slow motion is applied to Hanuman's leap, highlighting his joyful expression and the fluttering of his loincloth. During this slow-motion sequence, subtle golden particles representing divine energy begin to swirl around him. At 4s, the camera subtly rotates clockwise, offering a slightly different perspective of his ascent. From 4s to 6s, the camera speed returns to normal, and a very slight speed ramp is added, accelerating his movement. From 6s to 7s, the color palette intensifies slightly, with the sun becoming even more vibrant. At 6s, the sun seems closer. From 7s to 8s, the camera performs a quick zoom-in on Hanuman’s face as he nears the sun (without ever colliding). He is still beaming with pure joy. The video ends with the sun filling almost the entire frame. The animation prioritizes smooth, natural movements, even with stylized elements. The particle effects should be subtle and add to the magical atmosphere without being distracting. The overall pacing is quick and energetic but allows for moments of quiet beauty during the slow-motion sequence. Focus remains sharp on Hanuman throughout, with the sun remaining slightly blurred.
