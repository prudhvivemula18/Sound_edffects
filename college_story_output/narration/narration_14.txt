SCENE 14: Belief Quote

NARRATION TEXT:
Every step forward starts with belief. Light rises through the haze, and hope feels tangible in the morning air.

VOICE DIRECTION:
Warm, hopeful, and slightly breathy. The tone should be encouraging and inspiring, like a gentle mentor. Pacing is slow and deliberate, with a slight pause after 'belief.' Emphasize 'belief' and 'hope.' The overall mood is optimistic and peaceful. The voice should sound mature and experienced, but with a touch of youthful enthusiasm. Inflection should rise slightly on the final word, 'air,' to create a sense of uplift.
