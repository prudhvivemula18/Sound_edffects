SCENE 8: College Life Montage

NARRATION TEXT:
Every day, a fresh page. New friends, new ideas, a world waiting to be written.

VOICE DIRECTION:
Warm, optimistic, and slightly nostalgic. The tone should be comforting and encouraging, like a friendly mentor. Pacing should be slightly slower than conversational speed, with slight pauses between phrases to allow the words to resonate. The voice should be relatively young (20s-30s), but mature enough to sound credible. Emphasize 'fresh page,' 'new ideas,' and 'world waiting.' Overall mood: hopeful and inviting.
