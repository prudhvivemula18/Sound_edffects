SCENE 2: The Old Sneakers

NARRATION TEXT:
Old friends, faithful steps. Ready to face the campus, one day at a time.

VOICE DIRECTION:
Warm, gentle, and slightly nostalgic tone. The voice should sound mature but not old; mid-20s to early 30s. Pacing should be slow and deliberate, emphasizing 'Old friends' and 'one day at a time.' Convey a feeling of quiet resilience and hopeful determination. A slight smile should be audible in the voice. Emphasize 'faithful' and 'ready' as keywords, conveying the reliability of the sneakers and the individual's mindset.
