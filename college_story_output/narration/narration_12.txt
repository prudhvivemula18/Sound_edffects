SCENE 12: Approval

NARRATION TEXT:
A quiet nod, a heart's whisper. Approval blooms, a shared understanding taking root.

VOICE DIRECTION:
Warm and gentle, with a hint of gravitas. Pacing is slow and deliberate, with slight pauses after "nod" and "whisper". Emotion is primarily pride and affection. Voice character should be mature (50s-60s) but not frail. Emphasize the words "Approval" and "understanding." Overall mood should be comforting and hopeful, like a loving grandmother sharing a life lesson.
