SCENE 11: Presentation Day

NARRATION TEXT:
Ideas ignite, confidence takes flight. Her words inspire, engaging every mind in sight.

VOICE DIRECTION:
Warm, inspiring tone. Pacing should be slightly slower than conversational speed, with slight pauses between clauses. Voice should be energetic, but not overly excitable; think 'trustworthy mentor' meets 'passionate advocate'. Emphasize 'ignite', 'flight', and 'inspire'. Overall mood is uplifting and optimistic, conveying the power of ideas and the impact of effective communication.
