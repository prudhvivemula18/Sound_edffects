SCENE 11: Presentation Day

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The video opens with a subtle, slow push-in from a slightly wider shot to a tighter close-up on the student's face as she speaks. This initial zoom lasts approximately 2 seconds, emphasizing her confident expression. Her right hand moves gracefully in a sweeping gesture, timed perfectly with a key word in her presentation. The camera then performs a very subtle, almost imperceptible, pan to the left, following the line of her gesture, revealing a brief glimpse of the projection screen behind her (1 second). Next, a quick, subtle rack focus shifts from the presenter to a student in the front row, subtly nodding in agreement (1 second). This establishes the engaged audience. For the remaining 4 seconds, the camera slowly zooms out again, regaining the initial medium close-up framing. During the zoom out, subtle dust motes are animated in the sunbeams streaming from the windows. The key beat is at the 4-second mark when the zoom out begins, coinciding with the apex of the student's gesture. The pacing is deliberately measured, allowing the viewer to absorb the information and atmosphere. Use smooth, cinematic camera movements, avoiding any jarring or abrupt transitions. The character's movements should feel natural and fluid, conveying both confidence and approachability. The overall effect should be one of quiet admiration and attentive listening. A subtle, warming color grade should be applied, enhancing the golden hour feel of the lighting. Consider adding a very slight anamorphic lens flare effect to the light streaming through the windows for added visual interest.
