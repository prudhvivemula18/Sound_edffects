SCENE 8: College Life Montage
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds: a gentle mix of distant chatter, the rustling of leaves, the faint hum of traffic, and the subtle sound of footsteps on the brick walkways. Action-specific sounds: the crisp thwack of the frisbee being caught, the soft clinking of coffee cups, the muffled laughter of the students, the scratch of a pencil on paper. Music: a gentle, acoustic guitar melody with a hint of piano, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The music should build subtly as the clip progresses, reaching a crescendo at the 6-second mark before fading out slightly. Use a subtle whooshing sound effect during the transitions between shots to create a sense of fluidity. The overall sound design should be immersive and realistic, drawing the viewer into the world of the college quadrangle. A touch of birds chirping in the background adds to the idyllic atmosphere. Sound effects are mostly diegetic, giving a sense of realism, with the music providing a slightly elevated emotional underpinning.
