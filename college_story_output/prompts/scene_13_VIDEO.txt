SCENE 13: Rain Walk
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The camera begins with a slow, deliberate push-in, starting wide enough to capture the reflected cityscape and gradually focusing on the solitary figure walking away. The camera tracks the figure horizontally, maintaining a consistent distance and perspective. The figure walks at a measured, unhurried pace, their head slightly bowed. Raindrops visibly fall and create ripples on the wet pavement and puddles. Streetlights flicker subtly, creating a dynamic play of light and shadow on the reflections. Wind gently rustles the branches of the lone tree. At the 3-second mark, the figure pauses briefly, perhaps adjusting their collar or taking a deep breath, before continuing their walk. The pace of the walk remains consistent throughout the 8 seconds. Transition: a subtle lens flare appears as a streetlight passes by, adding a touch of visual interest. The overall pacing is slow and deliberate, mirroring the figure's contemplative mood. Key moments: the initial reveal of the reflected cityscape, the brief pause by the figure, and the subtle lens flare. Cinematic techniques: use shallow depth of field to maintain focus on the figure and create a sense of intimacy. Slow, deliberate camera movements emphasize the quiet and contemplative mood. Add very subtle camera shake to give a sense of realism. Emphasize the contrast between light and shadow to enhance the visual drama.
