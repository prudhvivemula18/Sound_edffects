SCENE 13: Rain Walk
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A solitary figure walks along a rain-slicked city street at twilight. The time is dusk, with the last vestiges of a warm, golden sunset fighting through heavy, overcast clouds. The overall light is soft and diffused, with a color temperature leaning towards cool blues and purples (around 6000K). Streetlights cast elongated, slightly distorted reflections on the wet pavement. The camera angle is low, almost ground level, creating a sense of intimacy and emphasizing the reflections. Framing is slightly off-center, placing the figure on the left third of the frame, allowing the reflected cityscape to dominate the right two-thirds. The environment is a typical urban setting: tall buildings with shimmering, reflective glass facades, wet asphalt, a few scattered puddles, and a lone, leafless tree struggling to survive near the curb. The figure is walking away from the camera, dressed in a dark grey overcoat, their collar pulled up against the rain. Their shoulders are slightly slumped, suggesting weariness but not despair. The color palette is dominated by cool blues, greys, and purples, punctuated by the warm amber glow of the streetlights and the fading sunset. Textures are crucial: the slick, reflective asphalt, the coarse texture of the building facades, the smooth, wet fabric of the coat, and the subtle ripples in the puddles. The style should evoke a sense of quiet contemplation and melancholic beauty, reminiscent of Edward Hopper's paintings or the cinematography of 'Blade Runner 2049'. Depth of field is shallow, focusing sharply on the figure and blurring the distant cityscape, drawing the viewer's attention to the individual's solitude. Focus Point: the nape of the neck of the walking figure. Include the slightest visible vapor of a breath in the cool air.
