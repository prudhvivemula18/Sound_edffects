SCENE 2: The Old Sneakers
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The scene begins with the sneakers already in focus. The camera slowly, almost imperceptibly, dollies *slightly* to the left, revealing a millimeter more of the edge of the bed. This movement is exceptionally slow and should take up the first 3 seconds. From seconds 3 to 5, the fingers tracing the laces move *slightly* more deliberately, re-tying the laces with purpose. There's a subtle 'tightening' animation where the laces visibly pull closer together. From seconds 5 to 7, the camera performs a very gentle zoom in, increasing the focus on the knot where the laces are tied. This zoom should be almost unnoticeable, but still create a feeling of closeness. In the final second (seconds 7 to 8), a very subtle light bloom effect flares across the frame as if the sun brightened behind the window. This light bloom should be very brief and almost subliminal. The animation style is hyper-realistic, focusing on micro-movements and authentic textures. The pacing is slow and deliberate, building a sense of anticipation. The key moment is the tightening of the laces, visually representing the start of a new day and a renewed sense of purpose. Avoid any fast cuts or jarring movements. Focus on smooth, organic motion. Consider adding extremely subtle environmental animation like dust motes floating in the sunbeams to add realism and depth.
