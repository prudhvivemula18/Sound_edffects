SCENE 1: Wake-Up Call
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Ultra-detailed photorealistic image of a dorm room slowly waking up. It's early morning, around 6:30 AM. Sunlight streams in through slightly open Venetian blinds, casting long, diffused, and warm (2700K) rays across the room. Dust motes are visible in the sunbeams. The camera angle is a low-angle, slightly wide shot, positioned near the foot of the bed, looking towards the headboard and the window. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the bed and sleeping student occupying the lower third, and the window and sunlight the upper two-thirds. The dorm room is small and tidy but lived-in. A single bed is the main feature, with rumpled blue and white striped cotton sheets and a slightly flattened pillow. A wooden nightstand beside the bed holds a half-empty glass of water, a well-worn copy of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' and a charging smartphone displaying 6:28 AM. On the wall above the bed hangs a framed poster of a vintage Wes Anderson movie (e.g., 'The Royal Tenenbaums'). A worn-out but clean rug (Persian style, muted colors) lies partially visible on the floor. A desk is partially visible to the right, cluttered with textbooks, notebooks, and a half-eaten bag of chips. The color palette is dominated by warm tones – yellows, oranges, and browns – contrasted by the cool blues and whites of the bedding. The mood is peaceful and serene, with a hint of melancholy. The focus is sharply on the student's face and the sunlight filtering through the blinds, with a shallow depth of field that gently blurs the background. The student, a young woman with messy brown hair, is lying on her side, her face partially buried in the pillow. She is just starting to stir, her eyes barely open. Her expression is one of drowsy contentment. The overall style is inspired by the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, emphasizing natural light and shallow depth of field. Imagine the light quality in 'The Tree of Life' but applied to a dorm room setting.
