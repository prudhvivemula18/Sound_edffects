SCENE 9: Rejection (Phone Scene)
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A dimly lit, close-up shot inside a cozy bedroom at night. Rain streaks heavily down the windowpane, blurring the cityscape lights outside into soft, impressionistic orbs. The focus is on a hand holding a smartphone. The phone screen illuminates the face with a cool, blue light, casting upward shadows. The wallpaper is a muted, floral pattern, slightly faded, suggesting age and familiarity. A soft, warm light emanates from a bedside lamp, partially visible out of focus in the background. The lamp has a fabric shade, casting a gentle, diffused glow. The hand holding the phone is slightly trembling. The phone displays a text message notification: simply "Read." The bedsheets are rumpled and a dark indigo color, with a few visible creases and folds, suggesting recent use. A partially visible pillow is also indigo, with a faint floral embroidery along the edge. The room's color palette is dominated by cool blues and muted warm yellows, creating a melancholic and introspective mood. The overall texture is soft and slightly grainy, evocative of a still from a film. The reflection of the phone screen is visible in the person's eyes, showing a hint of vulnerability and disappointment. The scene should evoke a sense of loneliness and quiet contemplation. The aesthetic should be reminiscent of a Wong Kar-Wai film still or a Gregory Crewdson photograph, focusing on atmospheric details and evocative lighting. The depth of field is shallow, blurring the background and emphasizing the hand holding the phone and the notification on the screen. The dominant colors are deep indigo, cool blue, and muted gold, giving a sense of quiet sadness.
