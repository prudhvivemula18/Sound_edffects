SCENE 6: Library Collaboration
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The scene begins with a gentle push-in shot, starting slightly wider to establish the library environment and then slowly zooming in on the students' hands and faces. The camera movement is smooth and deliberate, creating a sense of intimacy and focus. The main camera movement is a slow, subtle arc around the table to emphasize the collaboration. The woman gestures with her hand, emphasizing a point on the document. Her fingers tap lightly on the page. The man nods in agreement, his head moving slightly. The light changes subtly as the scene progresses, mimicking the passage of time. Particles of dust float slowly through the sunbeams, adding depth and realism. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the viewer to absorb the details of the scene. Key moments include the woman's gesture, the man's nod, and the subtle hand contact. Cinematic techniques to use: shallow depth of field to focus attention, subtle camera movement to create a sense of intimacy, and realistic lighting to enhance the mood. End the shot with a slight hold on the most focused part of the document/collaboration effort. The animation should be smooth and realistic, paying attention to the subtle movements of the students' bodies and the delicate interactions between them. The final second should feature a slight zoom into the document, highlighting the collaborative effort.
