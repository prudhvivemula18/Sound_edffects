SCENE 11: Presentation Day
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The scene opens with the subtle ambient hum of the lecture hall's ventilation system and the faint, rustling sound of papers being turned in the audience. A distinct 'click' of the projector focusing subtly underscores the initial zoom. As the student gestures, a very light 'whoosh' sound effect emphasizes the movement, almost subliminal, adding a sense of energy. Underneath these ambient sounds, a gentle, inspiring musical score begins to build. The music features acoustic guitar and piano, with a subtle string section swelling gently as the student's confidence shines through. At the 4-second mark, a subtle, positive chime sound effect marks the focus shift. The music then crescendos slightly as the camera zooms out, culminating in a feeling of hopeful anticipation. The overall sound design should be immersive and supportive, enhancing the visual narrative without being intrusive. The goal is to create a sense of intellectual excitement and shared inspiration.
