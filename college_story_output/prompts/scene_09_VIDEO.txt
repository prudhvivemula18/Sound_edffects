================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The scene begins with a static shot of the hand holding the phone, focusing on the screen. At second 1, the camera subtly zooms in, emphasizing the "Read" notification. From second 2 to 4, a very slight trembling effect is added to the hand holding the phone. The light from the phone screen subtly flickers, mimicking the emotional unease. At second 4, a gentle bokeh effect intensifies on the raindrops on the window, drawing attention to the rain outside. From second 5 to 7, a subtle camera shake, simulating a deep sigh, is implemented. The glow from the bedside lamp in the background pulsates gently. At second 7, the camera slowly begins to pull back, widening the shot slightly, showing more of the rumpled bedsheets. At second 8, the scene fades to black. The pacing should be slow and deliberate, allowing the viewer to absorb the emotion of the moment. The key moment is at second 1 when the focus is on the word "Read". The overall rhythm is melancholic and slow, creating a sense of quiet reflection. Utilize cinematic techniques such as shallow depth of field and subtle camera movements to enhance the emotional impact. The transition is a simple fade to black, signifying the end of the moment and the beginning of reflection.
