IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A breathtaking sunrise over a serene mountain valley. It is early morning, with the first rays of golden light piercing through a thick layer of ground fog. The light is warm and ethereal, casting long, soft shadows across the landscape. The color temperature is around 2800K, creating a feeling of warmth and hope. The camera angle is a wide, low-angle shot, emphasizing the scale of the valley and the height of the mountains. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the most prominent mountain peak positioned slightly off-center. The valley floor is covered in a dense blanket of mist, swirling gently as the sunlight warms it. Small patches of wildflowers are visible, their petals catching the light. A winding dirt path leads into the valley, disappearing into the fog. The path is slightly worn, suggesting it is frequently used. The mountain peaks are rugged and snow-capped, their textures detailed with sharp rocks and crevices. The sky above is a gradient of colors, transitioning from deep blues and purples near the horizon to pale oranges and yellows higher up. The overall mood is peaceful, hopeful, and inspiring. The color palette is dominated by warm oranges, yellows, and golds, contrasted by cool blues and purples. The texture details are sharp and realistic, conveying the raw beauty of nature. The depth of field is wide, allowing all elements of the scene to be in focus. The scene is reminiscent of a landscape painting by Albert Bierstadt, with a modern, photorealistic rendering style. Cinematography inspired by Emmanuel Lubezki, focusing on natural light and sweeping vistas. Lens flare is subtle and organic, adding to the ethereal feel. Focus is sharpest on the wildflowers and the winding path, drawing the viewer into the scene.
