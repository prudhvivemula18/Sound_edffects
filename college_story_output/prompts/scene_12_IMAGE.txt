SCENE 12: Approval
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Close-up, slightly low angle, focusing tightly on two characters: an older woman and a younger man. The woman, mid-sixties with kind eyes etched with gentle laugh lines, is seated in a sun-drenched workshop. Light streams in through a large, dusty window behind her, creating soft, diffused highlights on her silver hair and casting long, warm shadows across the room. The light is golden hour - a warm 2700K, creating a sense of nostalgia and comfort. The man, early twenties, stands just to her right, slightly out of focus. He's dressed in a simple, worn denim shirt. His expression is hopeful, a slight tension in his brow. The workshop is filled with the comforting clutter of a potter's studio: shelves stacked with unfinished clay pieces, tools scattered across a scarred wooden workbench, and a potter's wheel dominating the background. Clay dust hangs in the air, catching the light. Color palette is warm and earthy: terracotta, ochre, cream, and soft blues. The woman's clothing is muted and comfortable - a worn cotton cardigan in a faded blue-grey. The scene evokes a sense of quiet pride and affirmation. Her nod is subtle, almost imperceptible, but her smile is genuine and warm, crinkling the corners of her eyes. Focus is sharpest on the woman's face, particularly her eyes, highlighting the genuine emotion behind her approval. The depth of field is shallow, blurring the background and the man slightly, drawing the viewer's attention to her expression. Materials visible: weathered wood, rough clay, aged metal tools, soft cotton fabric. Cinematography inspired by the intimate portraits of Steve McCurry, focusing on capturing authentic human emotion in everyday settings. The composition uses the rule of thirds, with the woman's face positioned in the lower third of the frame.
