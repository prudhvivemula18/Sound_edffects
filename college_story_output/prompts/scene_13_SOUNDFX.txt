SCENE 13: Rain Walk
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds: a subtle, persistent rain soundscape, layered with the distant hum of city traffic. Add the distinct sound of footsteps splashing in puddles, varying in intensity based on the size of the puddle. Action-specific sound effects: the faint rustling of the figure's coat as they walk, the gentle dripping of water from the tree branches. Music: a slow, melancholic piano melody with a hint of hope, played with soft, sustained chords. Instruments: piano, cello, and a subtle atmospheric pad. Audio transitions: fade in the rain soundscape at the beginning of the clip, and fade out at the end. The music should be subtle and unobtrusive, enhancing the emotional impact of the visuals without overpowering them. Create a sense of depth and space by using reverb and spatial audio techniques. Emphasize the rhythm of the footsteps with subtle variations in volume and tone, creating a hypnotic and calming effect.
