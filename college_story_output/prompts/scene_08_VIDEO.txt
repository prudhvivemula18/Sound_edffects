SCENE 8: College Life Montage
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

Begin with a slow, subtle zoom in towards the student studying on the blanket. The camera starts wide, encompassing the entire quadrangle, then gradually focuses on her face. As the zoom progresses, subtly pan left to reveal more of the laughing students in the background. Wind gently rustles the leaves of the tree, creating dynamic shadows on the ground. The frisbee thrown by the students arcs across the frame in a smooth, almost dreamlike trajectory. The couple on the bench subtly shifts their posture, leaning closer together. The sketching student's hand moves quickly across the page. The sunlight gradually flares and dims, simulating the passage of time. At the 4-second mark, a quick cut to a close-up of the coffee cup near the studying student, steam rising in a swirling motion. Transition back to the wider shot with a slight push in. End with a slow, gentle pull back to showcase the bustling quadrangle again. The pacing is upbeat but relaxed, reflecting the energy of college life. The clip should feel like a series of fleeting, interconnected moments. Utilize subtle lens flares and bokeh to enhance the dreamlike quality. Use slight overcranking for some moments (frisbee throw, steam rising) to create a sense of slow-motion beauty.
