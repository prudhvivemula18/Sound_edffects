SCENE 12: Approval
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds: soft, crackling fireplace (subtle), distant birds chirping, the faint hum of a potter's wheel in the background. Action-specific sound effects: a subtle, almost inaudible creak of the wooden chair as the woman nods. Music style: minimalist, acoustic guitar melody with cello accompaniment. Instruments: acoustic guitar, cello. Audio transitions: a very subtle fade-in at the beginning and fade-out at the end. The music should be understated, providing a warm and supportive backdrop to the visual action. Focus on the subtle environmental audio to establish the realistic setting. The sound of the chair creaking amplifies the impact of the head nod, making it more emotionally resonant. The overall mood is peaceful and reassuring, reflecting the sense of approval and understanding.
