SCENE 5: Midnight Study
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A dimly lit, intimate close-up shot focusing on a student's hands typing on a laptop keyboard at midnight. The primary light source is a warm, slightly diffused desk lamp positioned just out of frame, casting a pool of amber light across the hands, keyboard, and a small portion of a worn, wooden desk. The desk lamp's color temperature is approximately 2700K, creating soft shadows and highlighting the key areas. The overall mood is one of quiet dedication and focused concentration. The background is significantly blurred, suggesting a cluttered but organized dorm room or study space. Visible in the periphery are stacks of textbooks, coffee mugs with condensation rings, and a half-eaten bowl of ramen. The laptop is a silver MacBook, showing slight wear and tear. The hands are young and slender, illuminated by the screen and desk lamp, revealing the subtle textures of skin and fingernails. The keyboard keys are slightly worn from use, with visible fingerprints. The camera angle is a slightly high angle, looking down on the hands and keyboard, creating a sense of intimacy and vulnerability. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the hands and keyboard in sharp focus while the background fades into a soft bokeh. The color palette is dominated by warm tones (amber, gold, browns) contrasted by the cool blues and grays of the laptop screen and surrounding shadows. Think of the cinematography style of a Wong Kar-wai film, emphasizing mood and atmosphere. Textural details are crucial: the smooth, cool metal of the laptop, the slightly rough texture of the wooden desk, the soft glow emanating from the screen, and the subtle details of the hands themselves, capturing the quiet struggle of late-night studying. Imagine a chiaroscuro painting, emphasizing light and shadow. Composition should subtly draw the eye towards the rhythmic typing action.
