SCENE 10: New Idea
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The 8-second clip opens with a static shot, tightly focused on the pencil tip and the blank page of the notebook, as described in the image prompt. At second 1, a subtle movement: the pencil twitches as if considering its next move. From second 1.5 to 3, the camera slowly, almost imperceptibly, zooms in even tighter on the pencil tip, emphasizing the potential energy held within. Simultaneously, a very faint, almost subliminal glow begins to emanate from the page directly beneath the pencil. From second 3 to 5, the pencil begins to glide smoothly across the page, leaving a thin, dark line. The camera tracks the pencil's movement, staying tightly focused on the point of contact. The light emanating from the page intensifies slightly. From second 5 to 7, the pencil continues to sketch, and the sketch becomes more defined, revealing a simple, abstract geometric shape - perhaps a stylized sun or a network of interconnected lines. The subtle glow intensifies further. From second 7 to 8, the camera pulls back very slightly to reveal more of the page and the objects around it. A subtle dust mote drifts across the beam of light. The glow fades slightly as the clip ends, leaving a feeling of quiet anticipation. The animation style should be realistic, with subtle movements and smooth transitions. Use slow, deliberate camera movements to build tension and emphasize the creative process. The pacing should be deliberate and unhurried, reflecting the slow unfolding of an idea. Avoid any abrupt cuts or transitions. Focus on creating a sense of peace and tranquility.
