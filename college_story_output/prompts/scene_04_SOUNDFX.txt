SCENE 4: Classroom Reflection
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The soundscape should be layered and subtle, creating an immersive and contemplative atmosphere. The primary ambient sound is a distant, muffled hum of city life outside the lecture hall window, filtered through the thick glass. This should be a low-frequency rumble, almost imperceptible but contributing to the overall sense of place. Interwoven with this is the faint creaking of old wood, specifically the subtle sounds of the lecture hall seats settling (recorded with a close microphone and then mixed subtly into the background). The dust motes dancing in the sunlight should be accompanied by a very high-frequency, almost inaudible, twinkling sound – a delicate chime-like effect, barely perceptible. The spreading ink animation should be accompanied by a subtle, dry scratching sound – akin to graphite on paper – adding texture and tactility. During the implied breeze, introduce a soft, almost imperceptible rustling sound, created by layering wind chimes and the faint sound of turning pages. Music should be minimal: a very subtle, ambient drone created with synthesized strings and a hint of piano, with a low sustain, centered around D minor. The audio transitions should be seamless and subtle, relying on gradual fades and crossfades to avoid jarring the listener. The overall mood conveyed through sound should be one of quiet contemplation, focused thought, and gentle tranquility. The intention is to immerse the viewer in the internal world of the student, creating a sense of shared experience and intellectual curiosity.
