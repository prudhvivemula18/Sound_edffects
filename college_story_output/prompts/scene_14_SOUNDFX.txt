SCENE 14: Belief Quote
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds should include the gentle chirping of birds, the distant rushing of a mountain stream, and the soft rustling of leaves in the breeze. The sound of the wind should be subtle and calming, creating a sense of peace. As the sun rises, the intensity of the bird sounds should gradually increase. Action-specific sound effects include the gentle crunch of footsteps on the dirt path (very faint) and the subtle whooshing of wind through the trees. Music should be a minimalist and ethereal piece, featuring acoustic guitar, piano, and strings. The tempo should be slow and calming, with a focus on creating a sense of hope and inspiration. Audio transitions should be smooth and seamless, creating a sense of continuity. The overall mood of the sound design should be peaceful, hopeful, and inspiring. The sound effects should enhance the visuals, creating a fully immersive experience. A very slight high-frequency shimmer to evoke the light itself.
