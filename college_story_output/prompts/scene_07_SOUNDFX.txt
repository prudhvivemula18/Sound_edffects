SCENE 7: Run Again
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The soundscape begins with subtle ambient sounds: distant city hum, gentle birdsong, and the faint rustling of leaves in the wind. As the runner's foot strikes the pavement, introduce a crisp, impactful 'thud' sound effect, layered with the soft 'whoosh' of their running shoes. The 'thud' should be subtly different for each foot strike, reflecting the uneven texture of the pavement. Add a gentle, uplifting instrumental piece composed primarily of strings and piano, gradually building in intensity throughout the 8 seconds. The music should be inspiring but not overwhelming, complementing the visual action and emotional tone. The ambient sounds should subtly increase in volume as the scene progresses, creating a sense of expanding energy. Transition: end with a short, sustained note on the piano, fading out as the camera zooms in on the runner's eyes. The sound design should create a sense of forward momentum and emotional resonance, underscoring the runner's determination and the promise of a new day. Subtle breathing sounds from the runner could be added to enhance the realism and sense of exertion.
