SCENE 3: Campus Walk
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A long, gently curving pathway bisects a classic university campus, bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning. The sun, just above the horizon, casts long, soft shadows that stretch across the meticulously maintained lawn. Towering oak trees line both sides of the path, their leaves displaying a mix of vibrant greens, golds, and hints of russet. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dappled patterns of light and shadow on the path below. The path itself is paved with aged, reddish-brown bricks, each showing subtle variations in color and texture. Dew clings to the grass blades, creating a sparkling effect in the sunlight. In the distance, a stately brick building with gothic architecture stands silhouetted against the bright sky. Details include ivy climbing the walls, arched windows reflecting the sunrise, and a prominent clock tower. The composition follows a leading lines approach, drawing the eye along the path towards the building. The camera angle is slightly low, emphasizing the height of the trees and the grandeur of the architecture. The depth of field is shallow, with the foreground slightly blurred to draw focus to the middle ground of the pathway. The overall mood is serene and peaceful, evoking a sense of academic tradition and quiet contemplation. Color palette is warm and inviting: golden yellows, deep reds, rich browns, and lush greens. Texture is paramount: the rough bark of the trees, the smooth coolness of the brick, the soft texture of the grass, the crispness of the morning air, the subtle fabric textures in the imagined student's backpack strap just coming into view in the mid-ground. Artistic style is reminiscent of a landscape painting by Thomas Cole, with a touch of impressionistic lighting. Cinematography is inspired by Roger Deakins, known for his naturalistic and atmospheric lighting.
