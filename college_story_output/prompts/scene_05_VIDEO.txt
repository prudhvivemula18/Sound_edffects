SCENE 5: Midnight Study
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The 8-second clip opens with a static shot for 1 second, establishing the scene: hands typing on a laptop keyboard illuminated by a desk lamp. A very slow, subtle zoom-in (dolly in) begins on the second second, imperceptible at first, gradually focusing more tightly on the fingers striking the keys. The fingers move with a determined, rhythmic pace, slightly faster than normal typing speed to convey urgency. Around second 4, a brief pause of approximately 0.2 seconds in the typing occurs, suggesting a moment of thought or inspiration, followed by a burst of faster typing as the idea solidifies. During this burst, a very subtle camera shake, almost imperceptible, adds a sense of energy and focus. From seconds 6 to 7.5, the zoom continues to subtly intensify, framing the hands even more closely. On second 7.5 a very brief, ethereal glow emanates from the laptop screen, lasting only 0.5 seconds, suggesting the formation of a brilliant idea. The final 0.5 seconds returns to the original framing, ending with a gentle fade to black. The clip should maintain a smooth, dreamlike quality, with no abrupt movements. Transition between the sections should be fluid and organic. Use subtle motion blur on the fingers to emphasize the speed and energy of the typing. The overall pacing should build anticipation, culminating in the brief glow from the laptop, and then softly fade out, leaving the viewer with a sense of accomplishment and quiet determination. Cinematic techniques like shallow depth of field and subtle camera movement should be used to enhance the emotional impact.
