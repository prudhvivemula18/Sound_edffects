SCENE 8: College Life Montage
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Ultra-wide angle shot, almost fisheye, looking down on a bustling college quadrangle during late afternoon golden hour. Sunlight streams in at a low angle, creating long, warm shadows that stretch across the brick walkways. The color temperature is warm, around 2800K, casting a golden hue on everything. In the foreground, a student sits on a checkered blanket, studying with an open textbook; her face is illuminated by the warm light, a slight smile playing on her lips. Texture details: the rough texture of the brick, the soft weave of the blanket, the smooth pages of the book. Around her, other students are engaged in various activities: a group laughing and throwing a frisbee, a couple engrossed in conversation on a bench, another student sketching in a notebook under a tree. The tree itself is large and leafy, casting dappled shadows on the ground. In the midground, the library entrance is visible, its large glass doors reflecting the golden light. Beyond the library, a hazy horizon line suggests the surrounding city. The color palette is dominated by warm tones – oranges, yellows, and reds – with pops of cooler blues and greens from the sky and foliage. The overall mood is vibrant, energetic, and hopeful. Depth of field is shallow, blurring the background slightly to keep the focus on the student in the foreground. Cinematography inspired by Wes Anderson's symmetrical compositions and use of color, combined with the warmth and intimacy of a coming-of-age film. Details like discarded coffee cups, scattered backpacks, and vibrant posters on the library bulletin board add to the sense of lived-in authenticity.
