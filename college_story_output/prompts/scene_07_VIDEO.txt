SCENE 7: Run Again
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

Start with a slow, sweeping camera movement from left to right, tracking slightly ahead of the runner. The camera is positioned low, close to the ground, to emphasize the power and force of each stride. As the runner's foot strikes the pavement, subtly shake the camera to simulate the impact. Maintain a steady tracking speed, matching the runner's pace. In the first 2 seconds, focus on the runner's feet hitting the pavement in slow motion, briefly cutting to their determined face in the third second. From seconds 3-6, maintain the sweeping tracking shot, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the runner's form and the surrounding environment. From seconds 6-8, accelerate the camera slightly, conveying a sense of increasing speed and momentum. Introduce subtle wind effects: gently sway the leaves on the saplings lining the pathway, and add particles of dust or moisture swirling in the air, catching the sunlight. The light should gradually brighten and intensify throughout the 8 seconds, as the sun rises higher. Key moments: the initial impact of the runner's foot on the pavement, the determined expression on their face, and the final surge of speed. Transition: end with a quick zoom in on the runner's eyes as they look forward with unwavering focus. Cinematic techniques: use slow-motion selectively to emphasize key movements, and employ shallow depth of field to maintain focus on the runner and blur distractions. The overall pacing should build gradually, culminating in a final burst of energy.
