SCENE 12: Approval
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The scene begins with a static shot, establishing the intimate setting. At second one, the camera subtly begins to zoom in *very* slowly on the woman's face. Between seconds two and three, the woman slowly nods her head – a small, almost imperceptible movement. At second four, the corners of her mouth begin to lift into a warm, genuine smile. The smile reaches her eyes by second five, crinkling them. From second six to eight, the zoom continues, subtly intensifying the focus on her eyes, capturing the depth of her approval. The animation of the nod and smile should be smooth and realistic, reflecting the natural aging process of the woman's face. Environmental animation: Dust motes slowly float in the sunbeams, creating subtle movement. Slight atmospheric haze catches the light. Pacing is deliberately slow and deliberate, emphasizing the weight of the moment. The rhythm is dictated by the slow, gentle movements of the woman's face. Key moments: the slight nod (second two-three), the beginning of the smile (second four), the crinkling of her eyes (second five). Transition: end abruptly at 8 seconds – cut to black. Use subtle lens flares from the window light to add cinematic realism. Subtle camera shake can be added to emulate handheld footage but minimized to ensure focus is maintained on the woman's face.
