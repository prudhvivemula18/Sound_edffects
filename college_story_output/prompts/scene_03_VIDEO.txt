SCENE 3: Campus Walk
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The video opens with a slow, steady tracking shot moving forward along the brick pathway. The camera maintains a consistent height, just above ground level, mimicking the perspective of someone walking. The camera slowly pans slightly from left to right, revealing more of the environment as the viewer progresses down the path. In the first two seconds, focus is sharp on the bricks directly in front of the 'viewer'. As the camera moves forward, the depth of field gradually shifts, bringing the trees and the distant building into sharper focus. The dappled sunlight on the path dances slightly, creating a subtle shimmer. Gentle breezes cause the leaves to rustle subtly. At second 4, a single student, only their backpack strap is initially visible as they walk into frame from the left, adding a human element to the scene. Their pace is measured and relaxed. Their presence is implied more than explicitly shown. As the camera continues forward, the student moves slightly ahead, never fully coming into full view. Transition effects are minimal, favoring a natural and seamless flow. Pacing is slow and deliberate, emphasizing the tranquility of the environment. The key moment occurs around second 6, when the sunlight catches the dew on the grass, creating a brief sparkle effect. Cinematic techniques include shallow depth of field, natural lighting, and slow, deliberate camera movements to create a sense of immersion and peacefulness.
