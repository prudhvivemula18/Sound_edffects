SCENE 1: Wake-Up Call
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds include very subtle morning birds chirping faintly in the distance, the gentle hum of a distant air conditioner, and the almost imperceptible rustling of bedsheets. When the sunlight comes through the blinds, add a subtle 'shimmering' sound effect. As the student stirs, incorporate soft sounds of her breathing and the creaking of the bed. The subtle background music should be a minimalist piano piece with a warm and melancholic tone, played at a very low volume. The piano melody should be simple and repetitive, creating a sense of calm and introspection. Audio transitions should be smooth and seamless, creating a cohesive and immersive soundscape. The overall mood should be peaceful and reflective, enhancing the emotional impact of the visuals. The key is subtlety; the sound design should enhance the scene without overwhelming it. Specific action-specific sounds are the quiet opening of the eyes (a subtle 'foley' sound, almost subliminal). The dust motes' movement are so subtle, perhaps the very slightest of high-frequency 'sparkles' can be added to only subtly accompany that action. A very quiet car passing in the street can be added at second 7.
