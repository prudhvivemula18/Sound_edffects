SCENE 2: The Old Sneakers
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds should include a very subtle early morning campus ambiance – distant birds chirping, faint sounds of students moving in nearby rooms (muffled conversations, rustling papers). A soft, barely audible hum from the building's HVAC system. The key sound effect is the subtle scratching sound of the fingers against the canvas and laces, meticulously captured with a high-quality microphone (ASMR-style). Add a slight 'snug' sound as the laces are tightened, indicating the firmness of the knot. The music should be a very subtle and atmospheric acoustic guitar melody – soft, melancholic, but ultimately hopeful. Think of a lullaby, played at an extremely low volume. Audio transitions should be smooth and seamless, fading in the campus ambiance at the beginning and fading out at the end. The overall sound design should evoke a feeling of comfort, familiarity, and quiet determination, mirroring the visual mood. The ambience is designed to give a sense of place while being unobtrusive and not distracting from the laces being tied.
