SCENE 4: Classroom Reflection
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

A close-up shot of an open notebook lying on a dark wood lecture hall desk. The notebook is slightly worn, with a soft, textured cream-colored paper. Fine lines of graphite from a recently erased sketch are barely visible. The page is filled with a mixture of neat cursive writing and rough diagrams in blue ink, depicting chemical structures and fragmented notes on organic chemistry. The camera angle is slightly canted, creating a sense of introspection and unease. Natural light filters in from a large, arched window to the left, casting long, soft shadows across the desk. The light has a warm, golden hue characteristic of late afternoon (4:00 PM), with a color temperature of approximately 3200K. Dust motes dance subtly in the sunbeams, adding a sense of tranquility and stillness. In the blurred background, out-of-focus rows of empty lecture hall seats are visible, upholstered in a muted burgundy velvet. The wooden floorboards are polished but show signs of wear and tear. A faint glint of sunlight reflects off a small, tarnished silver pen lying beside the notebook. The overall color palette is dominated by warm browns, muted reds, creams, and blues, creating a melancholic yet inviting atmosphere. The depth of field is shallow, focusing sharply on the notebook pages and subtly blurring the surrounding environment. The artistic style leans towards hyperrealism with a painterly touch, reminiscent of Rembrandt's chiaroscuro lighting. The image should evoke feelings of focused thought, quiet contemplation, and the gentle passage of time. Cinematography references include Roger Deakins' work in "Blade Runner 2049" for its use of light and shadow, and the detailed realism found in the paintings of Johannes Vermeer. The texture of the paper, the wood grain of the desk, and the fabric of the seats should be rendered with exceptional detail.
