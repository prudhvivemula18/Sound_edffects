SCENE 6: Library Collaboration
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The soundscape begins with subtle ambient sounds of a library: distant shuffling of papers, the quiet hum of air conditioning, and the occasional soft cough. A gentle rustling sound accompanies the turning of pages. As the woman gestures, add a delicate 'tap' sound effect. A soft, warm acoustic guitar melody plays in the background, creating a sense of intimacy and contemplation. The music gradually swells slightly in intensity as the scene progresses, building to a crescendo during the key moments of collaboration. The final second includes the distinct sound of pen writing smoothly on paper. Audio transitions should be seamless, creating a cohesive and immersive listening experience. The mood should be peaceful, focused, and uplifting, reinforcing the visual narrative. The rustling sound of pages needs a slightly higher frequency 'air' component, to enhance the realism. The ambient library sounds must be natural without dominating the dialogue or music.
