SCENE 5: Midnight Study
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The soundscape is dominated by the soft, rhythmic clicking of the laptop keyboard. The key presses should be distinct but not harsh, with subtle variations in pitch and volume to mimic realistic typing. A low, ambient hum of a computer fan provides a constant background layer. Faint sounds of late-night city life can be heard in the distance – a muffled car horn, the distant wail of a siren, subtly suggesting the quiet hours. At the moment of the ethereal glow, a faint, shimmering synth sound rises briefly, reaching a crescendo and then quickly fading, emphasizing the moment of inspiration. A subtle, low-frequency rumble should be present throughout, adding depth and weight to the audio. The overall sound design should create a sense of intimacy and focus, immersing the viewer in the student's dedicated world. No abrupt or jarring sounds. A very low volume, ambient, piano melody (think lofi) will run throughout. The keyboard sounds are crisp while the background ambient noises and piano fade into the background, creating a layer of depth.
