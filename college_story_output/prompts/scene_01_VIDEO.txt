SCENE 1: Wake-Up Call
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The 8-second clip begins with a static shot described in the IMAGE_PROMPT for 2 seconds. At second 2, the camera begins a slow, smooth zoom in on the student's face as she stirs. The zoom continues until the end of the shot at second 6. At second 4, the student slowly opens her eyes, blinking a few times as she adjusts to the light. At second 5, she turns her head slightly towards the window and the sunlight. From second 6 to 8, the camera slowly pans from the student's face, following the direction of her gaze, to the sunlight filtering through the blinds, showcasing the dust motes dancing in the light. The animation of the student's movement is subtle and realistic, avoiding any sudden or jerky motions. Dust motes in the sunbeams are animated with a gentle, randomized movement. The overall pacing is slow and deliberate, emphasizing the peacefulness of the scene. The key moment is the student opening her eyes, which should be timed to coincide with the zoom reaching its closest point. Use cinematic techniques such as shallow depth of field and natural lighting to create a sense of intimacy and realism. The camera movement should be smooth and steady, mimicking the movement of a Steadicam. The transition from the static shot to the zoom should be seamless and almost imperceptible.
