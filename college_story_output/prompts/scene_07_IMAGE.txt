SCENE 7: Run Again
================================================================================

IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT

Ultra-wide, cinematic shot. Dawn light, cool and ethereal, breaking over a cityscape barely visible in the background haze. The sun, just crested the horizon, casts long, soft shadows stretching away from the runner. Golden hour light rakes across the runner's face, highlighting beads of sweat clinging to their brow and upper lip. They are mid-stride, perfectly balanced, legs powering forward. Focus is razor-sharp on the runner's determined expression: a slight grimace of effort, but with an underlying strength and resolve in their eyes. Clothing: performance running gear, dark blue breathable top clinging slightly with sweat, black shorts, and vibrant orange running shoes laced tight. The pavement underfoot is slightly damp from the morning dew, reflecting the light and adding a subtle shimmer. Texture of the pavement is visible: small cracks, subtle variations in color, and the faint sheen of moisture. The surrounding environment: a modern, minimalist urban park pathway, lined with stylized metal benches and newly planted saplings. Faint mist rises from the grass on either side. Color palette: predominantly cool blues and grays in the background, contrasted by the warm golden sunlight and the vibrant orange of the shoes. Mood: determined, energetic, hopeful. Cinematography inspired by the opening scene of 'Chariots of Fire', but with a modern, urban twist. Depth of field: shallow, blurring the cityscape in the background and subtly softening the edges of the park pathway, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the runner's face and the motion of their stride. Details should include condensation forming on a metal water bottle strapped to the runner's waist, and subtle details of muscle definition in their legs. The runner appears to be in their late 20s or early 30s, with a strong, athletic build.
