SCENE 4: Classroom Reflection
================================================================================

VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT

The video begins with a static, close-up shot of the notebook as described in the image prompt. At second 1, the camera begins a very slow, subtle push-in, moving approximately 2 inches closer to the notebook page. Simultaneously, a very slight lens flare appears emanating from the upper left corner, gently sweeping across the page. From second 2 to 4, the dust motes in the sunbeams begin to subtly swirl and dance, creating a gentle sense of movement. From second 4 to 6, a subtle animation is introduced: the ink on the page appears to subtly darken and spread, as if the writer is still subconsciously processing the information. This effect is incredibly subtle, almost imperceptible. At second 6, the camera executes a very slow and gentle tilt upwards, revealing a slightly larger portion of the blurred lecture hall in the background. From second 6 to 7, a very faint breeze is implied by a subtle ripple effect on the dust motes and a nearly imperceptible rustling sound (created in the sound design). Finally, from second 7 to 8, the camera holds steady, allowing the viewer to fully absorb the scene. The pacing is deliberately slow and meditative, emphasizing the feeling of quiet contemplation. The key moment is the subtle darkening of the ink, suggesting the writer's continued engagement with the subject matter. The transition effect should be seamless, relying primarily on subtle camera movements and environmental animations. Cinematic techniques to use include slow motion (applied to the dust motes) and shallow depth of field to maintain focus on the notebook. The overall rhythm is calm and deliberate, mirroring the internal thoughts of the unseen student.
