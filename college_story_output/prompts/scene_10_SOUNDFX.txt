SCENE 10: New Idea
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

Ambient sounds: Subtle birdsong in the distance, the faint rustling of leaves outside the window (very low volume). A gentle, almost imperceptible hum of electricity from a nearby lamp. Action-specific sound effects: A soft 'skritch' sound as the pencil moves across the paper, carefully layered with variations in pressure and speed. The faint clinking of the ceramic mug as it rests on the desk. Music: A minimalist, ambient piece with a focus on piano and cello. The melody should be simple and uplifting, with a sense of gentle wonder. The music should swell slightly as the pencil begins to sketch, then fade back as the clip ends. Audio transitions: Use subtle fades and crossfades to create a seamless and immersive soundscape. The emphasis should be on creating a sense of peace and tranquility. Avoid any jarring or abrupt sounds. The overall sound design should enhance the visual elements and create a sense of emotional connection. The volume should be relatively low, allowing the ambient sounds and music to blend seamlessly together. Use reverb to create a sense of space and depth. Consider adding a subtle 'whoosh' sound effect as the glow intensifies, suggesting the sudden influx of inspiration. The overall mood is hopeful and inspiring.
