SCENE 3: Campus Walk
================================================================================

SOUND EFFECTS PROMPT

The soundscape begins with subtle ambient sounds of a campus waking up: distant birds chirping softly (robins and sparrows), the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze, and the faint sound of traffic in the far distance. As the camera moves forward, the sound of footsteps on the brick path becomes audible – a soft, rhythmic 'crunch-thud' sound. Layered beneath these sounds is a gentle, minimalist musical score consisting of acoustic piano and cello. The music is slow and melancholic, with a major key providing a sense of hope. At second 6, a subtle shimmer sound effect accompanies the sparkle of the dew. Audio transitions are smooth and seamless, creating a sense of continuity. The overall mood is peaceful and reflective, evoking a sense of calm and optimism. The sound design should enhance the visual experience, immersing the viewer in the tranquil atmosphere of the campus.
