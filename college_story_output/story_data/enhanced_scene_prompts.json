    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "Ultra-detailed photorealistic image of a dorm room slowly waking up. It's early morning, around 6:30 AM. Sunlight streams in through slightly open Venetian blinds, casting long, diffused, and warm (2700K) rays across the room. Dust motes are visible in the sunbeams. The camera angle is a low-angle, slightly wide shot, positioned near the foot of the bed, looking towards the headboard and the window. The composition follows the rule of thirds, with the bed and sleeping student occupying the lower third, and the window and sunlight the upper two-thirds. The dorm room is small and tidy but lived-in. A single bed is the main feature, with rumpled blue and white striped cotton sheets and a slightly flattened pillow. A wooden nightstand beside the bed holds a half-empty glass of water, a well-worn copy of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' and a charging smartphone displaying 6:28 AM. On the wall above the bed hangs a framed poster of a vintage Wes Anderson movie (e.g., 'The Royal Tenenbaums'). A worn-out but clean rug (Persian style, muted colors) lies partially visible on the floor. A desk is partially visible to the right, cluttered with textbooks, notebooks, and a half-eaten bag of chips. The color palette is dominated by warm tones – yellows, oranges, and browns – contrasted by the cool blues and whites of the bedding. The mood is peaceful and serene, with a hint of melancholy. The focus is sharply on the student's face and the sunlight filtering through the blinds, with a shallow depth of field that gently blurs the background. The student, a young woman with messy brown hair, is lying on her side, her face partially buried in the pillow. She is just starting to stir, her eyes barely open. Her expression is one of drowsy contentment. The overall style is inspired by the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki, emphasizing natural light and shallow depth of field. Imagine the light quality in 'The Tree of Life' but applied to a dorm room setting.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The 8-second clip begins with a static shot described in the IMAGE_PROMPT for 2 seconds. At second 2, the camera begins a slow, smooth zoom in on the student's face as she stirs. The zoom continues until the end of the shot at second 6. At second 4, the student slowly opens her eyes, blinking a few times as she adjusts to the light. At second 5, she turns her head slightly towards the window and the sunlight. From second 6 to 8, the camera slowly pans from the student's face, following the direction of her gaze, to the sunlight filtering through the blinds, showcasing the dust motes dancing in the light. The animation of the student's movement is subtle and realistic, avoiding any sudden or jerky motions. Dust motes in the sunbeams are animated with a gentle, randomized movement. The overall pacing is slow and deliberate, emphasizing the peacefulness of the scene. The key moment is the student opening her eyes, which should be timed to coincide with the zoom reaching its closest point. Use cinematic techniques such as shallow depth of field and natural lighting to create a sense of intimacy and realism. The camera movement should be smooth and steady, mimicking the movement of a Steadicam. The transition from the static shot to the zoom should be seamless and almost imperceptible.",
    "NARRATION_TEXT": "Dawn whispers through the blinds. Another day begins, a new page in her story.",
    "NARRATION_VOICE_DIRECTION": "Tone: Warm, hopeful, and slightly nostalgic. Emotion: Serene, reflective. Pacing: Slow and deliberate, with slight pauses between phrases. Voice Character: Young adult, female, calm, and gentle. Key words to emphasize: 'Dawn,' 'whispers,' 'new.' Overall mood: Peaceful anticipation.",
    "SOUND_FX": "Ambient sounds include very subtle morning birds chirping faintly in the distance, the gentle hum of a distant air conditioner, and the almost imperceptible rustling of bedsheets. When the sunlight comes through the blinds, add a subtle 'shimmering' sound effect. As the student stirs, incorporate soft sounds of her breathing and the creaking of the bed. The subtle background music should be a minimalist piano piece with a warm and melancholic tone, played at a very low volume. The piano melody should be simple and repetitive, creating a sense of calm and introspection. Audio transitions should be smooth and seamless, creating a cohesive and immersive soundscape. The overall mood should be peaceful and reflective, enhancing the emotional impact of the visuals. The key is subtlety; the sound design should enhance the scene without overwhelming it. Specific action-specific sounds are the quiet opening of the eyes (a subtle 'foley' sound, almost subliminal). The dust motes' movement are so subtle, perhaps the very slightest of high-frequency 'sparkles' can be added to only subtly accompany that action. A very quiet car passing in the street can be added at second 7.",

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A low-angle, close-up shot focuses sharply on a pair of extremely worn, but clean, Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars. The sneakers sit on a subtly textured, light-grey concrete dorm floor near the foot of a twin bed. The light is soft, diffused, and warm – early morning, around 7:00 AM – filtering in from a large, unseen window to the right of the frame. Color temperature should be around 3500K, creating a hopeful, awakening mood. Long, soft shadows stretch towards the left, hinting at the early hour. The sneakers are off-white, almost cream-colored from age and wear. The canvas is creased and slightly discolored, showing signs of countless walks across campus. The rubber soles are scuffed and marked, telling a visual story of their own. The laces are frayed in places, knotted loosely, and a warm beige color. Delicate, tanned fingers, belonging to a young adult (gender ambiguous, but with slender features), are carefully tracing the laces on the right shoe. The fingernails are neatly trimmed and unpolished. The fingers are subtly flexing, indicating a quiet moment of preparation and anticipation. The background is blurred (shallow depth of field), but we can make out the edge of a neatly made bed with a simple, denim-blue comforter. A stack of well-worn textbooks is barely visible on a nearby desk. The artistic style should evoke a sense of nostalgia and quiet resilience, reminiscent of a Wes Anderson film still with a touch of photo realism. The overall mood is calm, hopeful, and grounded, focusing on the familiar ritual of starting the day. Pay close attention to the texture of the canvas, the subtle wear and tear on the rubber, and the delicate details of the fingers interacting with the laces. Cinematography inspiration: Chloé Zhao’s naturalistic style, emphasizing raw, authentic textures and light.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The scene begins with the sneakers already in focus. The camera slowly, almost imperceptibly, dollies *slightly* to the left, revealing a millimeter more of the edge of the bed. This movement is exceptionally slow and should take up the first 3 seconds. From seconds 3 to 5, the fingers tracing the laces move *slightly* more deliberately, re-tying the laces with purpose. There's a subtle 'tightening' animation where the laces visibly pull closer together. From seconds 5 to 7, the camera performs a very gentle zoom in, increasing the focus on the knot where the laces are tied. This zoom should be almost unnoticeable, but still create a feeling of closeness. In the final second (seconds 7 to 8), a very subtle light bloom effect flares across the frame as if the sun brightened behind the window. This light bloom should be very brief and almost subliminal. The animation style is hyper-realistic, focusing on micro-movements and authentic textures. The pacing is slow and deliberate, building a sense of anticipation. The key moment is the tightening of the laces, visually representing the start of a new day and a renewed sense of purpose. Avoid any fast cuts or jarring movements. Focus on smooth, organic motion. Consider adding extremely subtle environmental animation like dust motes floating in the sunbeams to add realism and depth.",
    "NARRATION_TEXT": "Old friends, faithful steps. Ready to face the campus, one day at a time.",
    "NARRATION_VOICE_DIRECTION": "Warm, gentle, and slightly nostalgic tone. The voice should sound mature but not old; mid-20s to early 30s. Pacing should be slow and deliberate, emphasizing 'Old friends' and 'one day at a time.' Convey a feeling of quiet resilience and hopeful determination. A slight smile should be audible in the voice. Emphasize 'faithful' and 'ready' as keywords, conveying the reliability of the sneakers and the individual's mindset.",
    "SOUND_FX": "Ambient sounds should include a very subtle early morning campus ambiance – distant birds chirping, faint sounds of students moving in nearby rooms (muffled conversations, rustling papers). A soft, barely audible hum from the building's HVAC system. The key sound effect is the subtle scratching sound of the fingers against the canvas and laces, meticulously captured with a high-quality microphone (ASMR-style). Add a slight 'snug' sound as the laces are tightened, indicating the firmness of the knot. The music should be a very subtle and atmospheric acoustic guitar melody – soft, melancholic, but ultimately hopeful. Think of a lullaby, played at an extremely low volume. Audio transitions should be smooth and seamless, fading in the campus ambiance at the beginning and fading out at the end. The overall sound design should evoke a feeling of comfort, familiarity, and quiet determination, mirroring the visual mood. The ambience is designed to give a sense of place while being unobtrusive and not distracting from the laces being tied.",

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A long, gently curving pathway bisects a classic university campus, bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning. The sun, just above the horizon, casts long, soft shadows that stretch across the meticulously maintained lawn. Towering oak trees line both sides of the path, their leaves displaying a mix of vibrant greens, golds, and hints of russet. Sunlight filters through the leaves, creating dappled patterns of light and shadow on the path below. The path itself is paved with aged, reddish-brown bricks, each showing subtle variations in color and texture. Dew clings to the grass blades, creating a sparkling effect in the sunlight. In the distance, a stately brick building with gothic architecture stands silhouetted against the bright sky. Details include ivy climbing the walls, arched windows reflecting the sunrise, and a prominent clock tower. The composition follows a leading lines approach, drawing the eye along the path towards the building. The camera angle is slightly low, emphasizing the height of the trees and the grandeur of the architecture. The depth of field is shallow, with the foreground slightly blurred to draw focus to the middle ground of the pathway. The overall mood is serene and peaceful, evoking a sense of academic tradition and quiet contemplation. Color palette is warm and inviting: golden yellows, deep reds, rich browns, and lush greens. Texture is paramount: the rough bark of the trees, the smooth coolness of the brick, the soft texture of the grass, the crispness of the morning air, the subtle fabric textures in the imagined student's backpack strap just coming into view in the mid-ground. Artistic style is reminiscent of a landscape painting by Thomas Cole, with a touch of impressionistic lighting. Cinematography is inspired by Roger Deakins, known for his naturalistic and atmospheric lighting.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The video opens with a slow, steady tracking shot moving forward along the brick pathway. The camera maintains a consistent height, just above ground level, mimicking the perspective of someone walking. The camera slowly pans slightly from left to right, revealing more of the environment as the viewer progresses down the path. In the first two seconds, focus is sharp on the bricks directly in front of the 'viewer'. As the camera moves forward, the depth of field gradually shifts, bringing the trees and the distant building into sharper focus. The dappled sunlight on the path dances slightly, creating a subtle shimmer. Gentle breezes cause the leaves to rustle subtly. At second 4, a single student, only their backpack strap is initially visible as they walk into frame from the left, adding a human element to the scene. Their pace is measured and relaxed. Their presence is implied more than explicitly shown. As the camera continues forward, the student moves slightly ahead, never fully coming into full view. Transition effects are minimal, favoring a natural and seamless flow. Pacing is slow and deliberate, emphasizing the tranquility of the environment. The key moment occurs around second 6, when the sunlight catches the dew on the grass, creating a brief sparkle effect. Cinematic techniques include shallow depth of field, natural lighting, and slow, deliberate camera movements to create a sense of immersion and peacefulness.",
    "NARRATION_TEXT": "Dawn paints the campus gold. Each step echoes with possibility, carrying dreams forward.",
    "NARRATION_VOICE_DIRECTION": "Warm and slightly nostalgic tone. Pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing each word to resonate. The voice should be mature and calming, with a touch of optimism. Emphasize the words 'gold,' 'possibility,' and 'dreams.' The overall mood should be hopeful and reflective, conveying a sense of anticipation and potential.",
    "SOUND_FX": "The soundscape begins with subtle ambient sounds of a campus waking up: distant birds chirping softly (robins and sparrows), the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze, and the faint sound of traffic in the far distance. As the camera moves forward, the sound of footsteps on the brick path becomes audible – a soft, rhythmic 'crunch-thud' sound. Layered beneath these sounds is a gentle, minimalist musical score consisting of acoustic piano and cello. The music is slow and melancholic, with a major key providing a sense of hope. At second 6, a subtle shimmer sound effect accompanies the sparkle of the dew. Audio transitions are smooth and seamless, creating a sense of continuity. The overall mood is peaceful and reflective, evoking a sense of calm and optimism.

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A close-up shot of an open notebook lying on a dark wood lecture hall desk. The notebook is slightly worn, with a soft, textured cream-colored paper. Fine lines of graphite from a recently erased sketch are barely visible. The page is filled with a mixture of neat cursive writing and rough diagrams in blue ink, depicting chemical structures and fragmented notes on organic chemistry. The camera angle is slightly canted, creating a sense of introspection and unease. Natural light filters in from a large, arched window to the left, casting long, soft shadows across the desk. The light has a warm, golden hue characteristic of late afternoon (4:00 PM), with a color temperature of approximately 3200K. Dust motes dance subtly in the sunbeams, adding a sense of tranquility and stillness. In the blurred background, out-of-focus rows of empty lecture hall seats are visible, upholstered in a muted burgundy velvet. The wooden floorboards are polished but show signs of wear and tear. A faint glint of sunlight reflects off a small, tarnished silver pen lying beside the notebook. The overall color palette is dominated by warm browns, muted reds, creams, and blues, creating a melancholic yet inviting atmosphere. The depth of field is shallow, focusing sharply on the notebook pages and subtly blurring the surrounding environment. The artistic style leans towards hyperrealism with a painterly touch, reminiscent of Rembrandt's chiaroscuro lighting. The image should evoke feelings of focused thought, quiet contemplation, and the gentle passage of time. Cinematography references include Roger Deakins' work in \"Blade Runner 2049\" for its use of light and shadow, and the detailed realism found in the paintings of Johannes Vermeer. The texture of the paper, the wood grain of the desk, and the fabric of the seats should be rendered with exceptional detail.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The video begins with a static, close-up shot of the notebook as described in the image prompt. At second 1, the camera begins a very slow, subtle push-in, moving approximately 2 inches closer to the notebook page. Simultaneously, a very slight lens flare appears emanating from the upper left corner, gently sweeping across the page. From second 2 to 4, the dust motes in the sunbeams begin to subtly swirl and dance, creating a gentle sense of movement. From second 4 to 6, a subtle animation is introduced: the ink on the page appears to subtly darken and spread, as if the writer is still subconsciously processing the information. This effect is incredibly subtle, almost imperceptible. At second 6, the camera executes a very slow and gentle tilt upwards, revealing a slightly larger portion of the blurred lecture hall in the background. From second 6 to 7, a very faint breeze is implied by a subtle ripple effect on the dust motes and a nearly imperceptible rustling sound (created in the sound design). Finally, from second 7 to 8, the camera holds steady, allowing the viewer to fully absorb the scene. The pacing is deliberately slow and meditative, emphasizing the feeling of quiet contemplation. The key moment is the subtle darkening of the ink, suggesting the writer's continued engagement with the subject matter. The transition effect should be seamless, relying primarily on subtle camera movements and environmental animations. Cinematic techniques to use include slow motion (applied to the dust motes) and shallow depth of field to maintain focus on the notebook. The overall rhythm is calm and deliberate, mirroring the internal thoughts of the unseen student.",

Key words to emphasize: \"Ideas,\" \"shape,\" \"fades,\" \"unfolds.\" Overall mood: Introspective and thoughtful.",
    "SOUND_FX": "The soundscape should be layered and subtle, creating an immersive and contemplative atmosphere. The primary ambient sound is a distant, muffled hum of city life outside the lecture hall window, filtered through the thick glass. This should be a low-frequency rumble, almost imperceptible but contributing to the overall sense of place. Interwoven with this is the faint creaking of old wood, specifically the subtle sounds of the lecture hall seats settling (recorded with a close microphone and then mixed subtly into the background). The dust motes dancing in the sunlight should be accompanied by a very high-frequency, almost inaudible, twinkling sound – a delicate chime-like effect, barely perceptible. The spreading ink animation should be accompanied by a subtle, dry scratching sound – akin to graphite on paper – adding texture and tactility. During the implied breeze, introduce a soft, almost imperceptible rustling sound, created by layering wind chimes and the faint sound of turning pages. Music should be minimal: a very subtle, ambient drone created with synthesized strings and a hint of piano, with a low sustain, centered around D minor. The audio transitions should be seamless and subtle, relying on gradual fades and crossfades to avoid jarring the listener. The overall mood conveyed through sound should be one of quiet contemplation, focused thought, and gentle tranquility. The intention is to immerse the viewer in the internal world of the student, creating a sense of shared experience and intellectual curiosity.",

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A dimly lit, intimate close-up shot focusing on a student's hands typing on a laptop keyboard at midnight. The primary light source is a warm, slightly diffused desk lamp positioned just out of frame, casting a pool of amber light across the hands, keyboard, and a small portion of a worn, wooden desk. The desk lamp's color temperature is approximately 2700K, creating soft shadows and highlighting the key areas. The overall mood is one of quiet dedication and focused concentration. The background is significantly blurred, suggesting a cluttered but organized dorm room or study space. Visible in the periphery are stacks of textbooks, coffee mugs with condensation rings, and a half-eaten bowl of ramen. The laptop is a silver MacBook, showing slight wear and tear. The hands are young and slender, illuminated by the screen and desk lamp, revealing the subtle textures of skin and fingernails. The keyboard keys are slightly worn from use, with visible fingerprints. The camera angle is a slightly high angle, looking down on the hands and keyboard, creating a sense of intimacy and vulnerability. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the hands and keyboard in sharp focus while the background fades into a soft bokeh. The color palette is dominated by warm tones (amber, gold, browns) contrasted by the cool blues and grays of the laptop screen and surrounding shadows. Think of the cinematography style of a Wong Kar-wai film, emphasizing mood and atmosphere. Textural details are crucial: the smooth, cool metal of the laptop, the slightly rough texture of the wooden desk, the soft glow emanating from the screen, and the subtle details of the hands themselves, capturing the quiet struggle of late-night studying. Imagine a chiaroscuro painting, emphasizing light and shadow. Composition should subtly draw the eye towards the rhythmic typing action.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The 8-second clip opens with a static shot for 1 second, establishing the scene: hands typing on a laptop keyboard illuminated by a desk lamp. A very slow, subtle zoom-in (dolly in) begins on the second second, imperceptible at first, gradually focusing more tightly on the fingers striking the keys. The fingers move with a determined, rhythmic pace, slightly faster than normal typing speed to convey urgency. Around second 4, a brief pause of approximately 0.2 seconds in the typing occurs, suggesting a moment of thought or inspiration, followed by a burst of faster typing as the idea solidifies. During this burst, a very subtle camera shake, almost imperceptible, adds a sense of energy and focus. From seconds 6 to 7.5, the zoom continues to subtly intensify, framing the hands even more closely. On second 7.5 a very brief, ethereal glow emanates from the laptop screen, lasting only 0.5 seconds, suggesting the formation of a brilliant idea. The final 0.5 seconds returns to the original framing, ending with a gentle fade to black. The clip should maintain a smooth, dreamlike quality, with no abrupt movements. Transition between the sections should be fluid and organic. Use subtle motion blur on the fingers to emphasize the speed and energy of the typing. The overall pacing should build anticipation, culminating in the brief glow from the laptop, and then softly fade out, leaving the viewer with a sense of accomplishment and quiet determination. Cinematic techniques like shallow depth of field and subtle camera movement should be used to enhance the emotional impact.",

    "SOUND_FX": "The soundscape is dominated by the soft, rhythmic clicking of the laptop keyboard. The key presses should be distinct but not harsh, with subtle variations in pitch and volume to mimic realistic typing. A low, ambient hum of a computer fan provides a constant background layer. Faint sounds of late-night city life can be heard in the distance – a muffled car horn, the distant wail of a siren, subtly suggesting the quiet hours. At the moment of the ethereal glow, a faint, shimmering synth sound rises briefly, reaching a crescendo and then quickly fading, emphasizing the moment of inspiration. A subtle, low-frequency rumble should be present throughout, adding depth and weight to the audio. The overall sound design should create a sense of intimacy and focus, immersing the viewer in the student's dedicated world. No abrupt or jarring sounds. A very low volume, ambient, piano melody (think lofi) will run throughout.

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A sun-drenched library scene. Golden hour sunlight streams through tall, arched windows lined with dark wood frames, casting elongated shadows across polished wooden tables. The light has a warm color temperature (around 3000K), creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Dust motes dance visibly in the sunbeams. The camera is positioned at a slight high angle, looking down on a table where two students are collaborating. The framing is medium close-up, focusing on their hands and the documents spread across the table. One student, a young woman with auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, gestures towards a page filled with handwritten notes and diagrams. Her expression is animated and enthusiastic. The other student, a young man with short, dark hair, leans forward, listening intently, a thoughtful expression on his face. Their hands occasionally brush, creating a subtle sense of connection. The table is cluttered with textbooks, open notebooks, pens, and a half-empty mug of coffee, adding to the lived-in feel. The background is softly blurred, showing rows of bookshelves filled with aged books, their leather spines faded and worn. Some books are slightly askew, suggesting heavy use. The overall color palette is warm and earthy, with tones of gold, brown, and cream. The mood is collaborative, focused, and inspiring. The scene should evoke the feeling of intellectual curiosity and shared discovery. Texture details are crucial: the smooth, polished wood of the table, the rough paper of the notebooks, the soft fabric of their clothing, and the subtle grain of the wood paneling behind the bookshelves. Depth of field is shallow, focusing on the students' hands and faces, with a gentle blur in the background. Artistic style: reminiscent of a Renaissance painting in its use of light and shadow, but with a modern, photo-realistic rendering. Cinematography inspiration: Roger Deakins, particularly his work on \"Skyfall\" and \"Blade Runner 2049\" for the use of dramatic lighting and shallow depth of field. The lighting is key to create a sense of intimacy and focus attention.",

The sun, just crested the horizon, casts long, soft shadows stretching away from the runner. Golden hour light rakes across the runner's face, highlighting beads of sweat clinging to their brow and upper lip. They are mid-stride, perfectly balanced, legs powering forward. Focus is razor-sharp on the runner's determined expression: a slight grimace of effort, but with an underlying strength and resolve in their eyes. Clothing: performance running gear, dark blue breathable top clinging slightly with sweat, black shorts, and vibrant orange running shoes laced tight. The pavement underfoot is slightly damp from the morning dew, reflecting the light and adding a subtle shimmer. Texture of the pavement is visible: small cracks, subtle variations in color, and the faint sheen of moisture. The surrounding environment: a modern, minimalist urban park pathway, lined with stylized metal benches and newly planted saplings. Faint mist rises from the grass on either side. Color palette: predominantly cool blues and grays in the background, contrasted by the warm golden sunlight and the vibrant orange of the shoes. Mood: determined, energetic, hopeful. Cinematography inspired by the opening scene of 'Chariots of Fire', but with a modern, urban twist. Depth of field: shallow, blurring the cityscape in the background and subtly softening the edges of the park pathway, drawing the viewer's eye directly to the runner's face and the motion of their stride.

Add a gentle, uplifting instrumental piece composed primarily of strings and piano, gradually building in intensity throughout the 8 seconds. The music should be inspiring but not overwhelming, complementing the visual action and emotional tone. The ambient sounds should subtly increase in volume as the scene progresses, creating a sense of expanding energy. Transition: end with a short, sustained note on the piano, fading out as the camera zooms in on the runner's eyes. The sound design should create a sense of forward momentum and emotional resonance, underscoring the runner's determination and the promise of a new day. Subtle breathing sounds from the runner could be added to enhance the realism and sense of exertion.",

Sunlight streams in at a low angle, creating long, warm shadows that stretch across the brick walkways. The color temperature is warm, around 2800K, casting a golden hue on everything. In the foreground, a student sits on a checkered blanket, studying with an open textbook; her face is illuminated by the warm light, a slight smile playing on her lips. Texture details: the rough texture of the brick, the soft weave of the blanket, the smooth pages of the book. Around her, other students are engaged in various activities: a group laughing and throwing a frisbee, a couple engrossed in conversation on a bench, another student sketching in a notebook under a tree. The tree itself is large and leafy, casting dappled shadows on the ground. In the midground, the library entrance is visible, its large glass doors reflecting the golden light. Beyond the library, a hazy horizon line suggests the surrounding city. The color palette is dominated by warm tones – oranges, yellows, and reds – with pops of cooler blues and greens from the sky and foliage. The overall mood is vibrant, energetic, and hopeful. Depth of field is shallow, blurring the background slightly to keep the focus on the student in the foreground. Cinematography inspired by Wes Anderson's symmetrical compositions and use of color, combined with the warmth and intimacy of a coming-of-age film. Details like discarded coffee cups, scattered backpacks, and vibrant posters on the library bulletin board add to the sense of lived-in authenticity.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "Begin with a slow, subtle zoom in towards the student studying on the blanket. The camera starts wide, encompassing the entire quadrangle, then gradually focuses on her face. As the zoom progresses, subtly pan left to reveal more of the laughing students in the background. Wind gently rustles the leaves of the tree, creating dynamic shadows on the ground. The frisbee thrown by the students arcs across the frame in a smooth, almost dreamlike trajectory. The couple on the bench subtly shifts their posture, leaning closer together. The sketching student's hand moves quickly across the page. The sunlight gradually flares and dims, simulating the passage of time. At the 4-second mark, a quick cut to a close-up of the coffee cup near the studying student, steam rising in a swirling motion. Transition back to the wider shot with a slight push in. End with a slow, gentle pull back to showcase the bustling quadrangle again. The pacing is upbeat but relaxed, reflecting the energy of college life. The clip should feel like a series of fleeting, interconnected moments. Utilize subtle lens flares and bokeh to enhance the dreamlike quality. Use slight overcranking for some moments (frisbee throw, steam rising) to create a sense of slow-motion beauty.",

    "NARRATION_VOICE_DIRECTION": "Warm, optimistic, and slightly nostalgic. The tone should be comforting and encouraging, like a friendly mentor. Pacing should be slightly slower than conversational speed, with slight pauses between phrases to allow the words to resonate. The voice should be relatively young (20s-30s), but mature enough to sound credible. Emphasize 'fresh page,' 'new ideas,' and 'world waiting.' Overall mood: hopeful and inviting.",
    "SOUND_FX": "Ambient sounds: a gentle mix of distant chatter, the rustling of leaves, the faint hum of traffic, and the subtle sound of footsteps on the brick walkways. Action-specific sounds: the crisp thwack of the frisbee being caught, the soft clinking of coffee cups, the muffled laughter of the students, the scratch of a pencil on paper. Music: a gentle, acoustic guitar melody with a hint of piano, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The music should build subtly as the clip progresses, reaching a crescendo at the 6-second mark before fading out slightly. Use a subtle whooshing sound effect during the transitions between shots to create a sense of fluidity. The overall sound design should be immersive and realistic, drawing the viewer into the world of the college quadrangle. A touch of birds chirping in the background adds to the idyllic atmosphere.

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A sun-drenched close-up on a wooden desk bathed in the golden light of early morning. The light streams in from a window just out of frame to the left, casting long, soft shadows that stretch across the textured surface of the desk. The wood is a warm oak, showing its natural grain and subtle imperfections, lightly worn but well-maintained. In the center of the frame, a Moleskine notebook lies open, its ivory pages slightly creased from use. A sharpened HB pencil rests diagonally across the right-hand page, its graphite tip catching the light. The page is nearly blank, except for a few faint pencil strokes – the beginnings of a geometric doodle, hinting at a burgeoning idea. Scattered around the notebook are other items: a vintage brass paperclip, slightly tarnished; a small, hand-thrown ceramic mug containing leftover cold coffee with a thin film on top; and a few stray dried leaves, perhaps blown in from the open window. The color palette is warm and inviting: golds, browns, creams, and subtle greens. The overall mood is peaceful, contemplative, and hopeful. Focus is sharply on the pencil tip and the immediate area of the notebook page around it, with a shallow depth of field blurring the mug and leaves slightly. Cinematography inspired by the work of Roger Deakins, focusing on natural light and tactile textures. Imagine the scene as a still life painting, meticulously rendered with incredible detail, emphasizing the beauty of everyday objects and the potential of a new day. The light should have a subtle volumetric quality, revealing dust motes dancing in the air. The desk should have a slightly dusty appearance, adding to the realism and lived-in feel. The metal on the paperclip should catch specular highlights from the sunlight. The overall style is hyperrealistic, aiming for photorealism with an artistic touch.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The 8-second clip opens with a static shot, tightly focused on the pencil tip and the blank page of the notebook, as described in the image prompt. At second 1, a subtle movement: the pencil twitches as if considering its next move. From second 1.5 to 3, the camera slowly, almost imperceptibly, zooms in even tighter on the pencil tip, emphasizing the potential energy held within. Simultaneously, a very faint, almost subliminal glow begins to emanate from the page directly beneath the pencil. From second 3 to 5, the pencil begins to glide smoothly across the page, leaving a thin, dark line. The camera tracks the pencil's movement, staying tightly focused on the point of contact. The light emanating from the page intensifies slightly. From second 5 to 7, the pencil continues to sketch, and the sketch becomes more defined, revealing a simple, abstract geometric shape - perhaps a stylized sun or a network of interconnected lines. The subtle glow intensifies further. From second 7 to 8, the camera pulls back very slightly to reveal more of the page and the objects around it. A subtle dust mote drifts across the beam of light. The glow fades slightly as the clip ends, leaving a feeling of quiet anticipation. The animation style should be realistic, with subtle movements and smooth transitions. Use slow, deliberate camera movements to build tension and emphasize the creative process. The pacing should be deliberate and unhurried, reflecting the slow unfolding of an idea.

    "IMAGE_PROMPT": "A breathtaking, hyperrealistic photograph capturing a student presentation bathed in the warm glow of late afternoon sun filtering through large windows. The student, a young woman with radiant confidence, stands center-frame, slightly to the right. She's wearing a subtly textured, dark blue blazer over a cream-colored blouse. Her dark hair is neatly styled, catching the light. She gestures dynamically with her right hand, palm open, as if emphasizing a key point. Her expression is one of passion and engagement, a slight smile playing on her lips, eyes sparkling with intelligence. The background consists of a modern university lecture hall. Rows of tiered seating are filled with attentive students, their faces blurred slightly in the depth of field, creating a sense of focus on the presenter. The back wall is a light gray, textured concrete, partially covered by a large projection screen displaying a minimalist graph with clean, vibrant lines in shades of teal and orange. Light beams stream through the windows on the left, creating dust motes visible in the air. The overall color palette is warm and inviting, with rich blues, creams, and grays punctuated by the pops of color in the graph. The lighting casts long, soft shadows, adding depth and dimension to the scene. The camera angle is slightly low, looking up at the presenter, enhancing her sense of authority and confidence. The depth of field is shallow, blurring the background and emphasizing the sharpness of the student and the nearest rows of listeners. The mood is positive, inspiring, and engaging. Think of the cinematography of a TED Talk, combined with the intimate portraiture of Annie Leibovitz. The surfaces of the desks are smooth, polished wood, reflecting the warm light. The fabric of the blazer has a subtle weave, visible upon close inspection. The air feels still and attentive, filled with the anticipation of learning. The focus point is on the student's face, particularly her eyes, capturing the intelligence and passion that drive her presentation.",
    "VIDEO_PROMPT": "The video opens with a subtle, slow push-in from a slightly wider shot to a tighter close-up on the student's face as she speaks. This initial zoom lasts approximately 2 seconds, emphasizing her confident expression. Her right hand moves gracefully in a sweeping gesture, timed perfectly with a key word in her presentation. The camera then performs a very subtle, almost imperceptible, pan to the left, following the line of her gesture, revealing a brief glimpse of the projection screen behind her (1 second). Next, a quick, subtle rack focus shifts from the presenter to a student in the front row, subtly nodding in agreement (1 second). This establishes the engaged audience. For the remaining 4 seconds, the camera slowly zooms out again, regaining the initial medium close-up framing. During the zoom out, subtle dust motes are animated in the sunbeams streaming from the windows. The key beat is at the 4-second mark when the zoom out begins, coinciding with the apex of the student's gesture. The pacing is deliberately measured, allowing the viewer to absorb the information and atmosphere. Use smooth, cinematic camera movements, avoiding any jarring or abrupt transitions. The character's movements should feel natural and fluid, conveying both confidence and approachability. The overall effect should be one of quiet admiration and attentive listening. A subtle, warming color grade should be applied, enhancing the golden hour feel of the lighting. Consider adding a very slight anamorphic lens flare effect to the light streaming through the windows for added visual interest.",

The light is golden hour - a warm 2700K, creating a sense of nostalgia and comfort. The man, early twenties, stands just to her right, slightly out of focus. He's dressed in a simple, worn denim shirt. His expression is hopeful, a slight tension in his brow. The workshop is filled with the comforting clutter of a potter's studio: shelves stacked with unfinished clay pieces, tools scattered across a scarred wooden workbench, and a potter's wheel dominating the background. Clay dust hangs in the air, catching the light. Color palette is warm and earthy: terracotta, ochre, cream, and soft blues. The woman's clothing is muted and comfortable - a worn cotton cardigan in a faded blue-grey. The scene evokes a sense of quiet pride and affirmation. Her nod is subtle, almost imperceptible, but her smile is genuine and warm, crinkling the corners of her eyes. Focus is sharpest on the woman's face, particularly her eyes, highlighting the genuine emotion behind her approval. The depth of field is shallow, blurring the background and the man slightly, drawing the viewer's attention to her expression.
